Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui.
Here is how to get it up and running:

1. Run the "install" script to install the web UI and its requirements in this folder.
2. Run the "download" script to download a model of your choice.
3. Run the "start-webui" script to launch the web UI.

To add flags like --chat, --notebook, --extensions, etc, edit the
"start-webui" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the line that says "python server.py...".

To get the latest updates in the future, just re-run the "install" script.
This will only install the updates, so it should be much faster.
